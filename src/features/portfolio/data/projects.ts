Built on top of modern cloud technologies, Kube Credential ensures that every credential is tamper-resistant, cryptographically verifiable, and compliant with industry standards.

**Frontend Demo:**

The live version of the project includes a functional frontend interface with a subset of UI features. This is intentional, because the company assignment required:

- A functional frontend demo
- Only a subset of UI features
- Not exposing full internal logic publicly

    description: `This is my older personal portfolio where I experimented with layouts, animations, and different UI ideas. It was my first attempt at building a clean, minimal developer profile with project highlights, contact sections, and custom components. I used it to explore new design patterns, try out different tech stacks, and understand how to present my work better before creating my current portfolio.

- Iterated on layouts, motion, and interaction patterns to learn what feels best
- Showcased project highlights, contact sections, and custom components in a minimal UI
- Served as a playground to test stacks and presentation approaches before the current site
